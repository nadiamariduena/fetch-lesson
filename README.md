## FETCH introduction

## What is fetch?

_The Fetch API is a simple interface for fetching resources. Fetch makes it easier to make web requests and handle responses than with the older XMLHttpRequest, which often requires additional logic (for example, for handling redirects). Note: Fetch supports the Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).


## Is Fetch better than Ajax

_Fetch is compatible with all recent browsers including Edge, but not with Internet Explorer. Therefore, if you are looking for maximum compatibility, you will continue to use Ajax to update a web page. If you also want to interact with the server, the WebSocket object is also more appropriate than fetch.


## Does IE supports Fetch

_5 Answers. Just include isomorphic-fetch as polyfill to make it work on unsupported browsers. As pointed out, fetch is not supported by IE11, I also had this problem in my React app. You can, alternatively, use Axios.May 14, 2018
